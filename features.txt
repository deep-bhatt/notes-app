This file contains backend decisions I made. I also try to make a case for why I think they're justified.

On Backend Stack:
- NodeJS / Express
  - NodeJS is pretty efficient at handling I/O bound tasks due to its event driven nature
  - I used Express since it's minimalistic framework

- PostgreSQL
  - It's an open-souce database engine, and also the one I was most comfortable with

- (optional) pgadmin
  - Helps while developement

- (optional) PM2 - Process Manager
  - Helps with vertically scaling NodeJS application by starting multiple Node
  processes on your cores, also has a built-in load balancer

RESTful APIs:
  - POST /register-user
  - POST /login
  - GET /notes
  - GET /notes/:id
  - POST /notes
  - PUT /notes/:id
  - DELETE /notes/:id
  - GET /version/notes/:id

Authentication:
  - Users first register using a password and a username (unique)
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, which also ensures salting
  - Passwords must have at least 6 characters including one special character
  - JWT are used for authenticating users -- uses a symmetric key
  - JWTs are stateless, and doesn't require a round trip to a DB -- helps with scaling the application
  - Notes CRUD & Version Control routes uses a middleware which verifies JWT token, and attaches user id in request context.

Version Control:
  - To version control notes, I used database triggers and function that runs when
  the trigger is invoked.
  - The trigger runs a function whenever there's an UPDATE on note's title or content
  - The function then logs the old and new value in version control database table

Database Bootstrap:
  - On server run or restart, a bootstrap script is run to ensure tables
  are created if they don't already exist
  - This can have drawbacks

Security:
  - SQL queries are parameterized to prevent SQL Injections
  - Every Note's CRUD endpoint has authentication and authorization checks
  - Appropiate CORS is set to only allow React client to read API resources
  - XSS are prevented in React by using string variables, since they are escaped automatically
  - Using Helmet npm package, we follow HTTP headers best practices -- eg. CSP, Anti-Clickjacking headers... etc
  - App is resilient to CSRF attacks
  - POST /login route is protected using an IP based rate limiter

Performance:
  - Database pooling is used - so we don't have to cold start a TCP connection
  - Indexes are created on relevant table's columns
  - Optionally, PM2 can be used to scale app vertically in a host

Further improvements that should be done:
  - Add unit tests
  - Use migrations library for managing database states
  - Use refresh tokens to refresh near expiry JWT - better User Experience
  - Prevent users from using a common password from a dictionary
  - Use Bloom Filters to check if username is already taken or not - saves a round-trip to the database
  - Partition `notes` table horizontally if it has millions and millions of rows
